# logo

> A repo containing the version history of our meetup's logo.


# Contributions
- Feel free to introduce any logo candidate under ```/drafts```.
- You can always experiment on the existing PSD (```ujug_trials.psd```) or create new ones from scratch
- For the above case, it is suggested that you commit both ```png``` and ```psd``` on a folder of yours, in a structure like below:

```
.
├── logo
│   ├── drafts
│   │   ├── john
│   │   │   ├── new_logo.png
│   │   │   ├── new_logo.psd
```
